# Hyperloop-app-
Hello Reader,
I hope this text finds you well.
This is just a quick explaination on how i came up with this Concept of a webpage. As the question says I needed to develop a webpage and describe my vision of Hyperloop. I came up with a subtle but interesting idea of a hyperloop train passing through the mountains. Firstly, I knew the basics of html but I brushed up on my concepts and I got to Work. I then started coding on this question which gave me a ton of errors which helped me analyse my mistakes :) 
 I then started spending time on brainstorming and researching on different layout formats. I then found an ideal one which I liked.I then used the source images and began to code.I used a parallax effect in order to make it look better. As the design process took me long , I made it as engaging and user friendly as possible. This work has been a good experience to me in my coding journey. Kudos to Fireship and such other youtube channels which helped me get through this.
 
PS- Try scrolling the website slowly using the scroll bar on the right to see the animations better.

Thank you for reading through!
