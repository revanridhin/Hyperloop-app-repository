      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Avishkar, the research and development team of the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, has made remarkable strides in creating the first-ever hyperloop prototype in India. The Hyperloop is a futuristic mode of transportation that was conceptualized by entrepreneur Elon Musk in 2012. The technology involves a high-speed train-like capsule traveling through a vacuum-sealed tube at speeds exceeding 1000 km/h. This revolutionary idea has gained significant momentum worldwide, and Avishkar has been at the forefront of this innovation in India.

        Avishkar's hyperloop prototype consists of a capsule designed to travel at a speed of 400 km/h through a 1.2 km long tube. The team has worked tirelessly to develop a prototype that is efficient and sustainable, utilizing the latest technology available. The design of the capsule incorporates cutting-edge technology in aerodynamics, levitation, and propulsion. The capsule is made of lightweight materials and powered by a magnetic propulsion system, enabling it to travel through the tube at high speeds with minimal energy consumption.              
        Hyperloop and other innovative projects is a testament to the ingenuity and creativity of Indian engineers and scientists. Their work has the potential to transform the transportation and agricultural sectors in India and contribute to sustainable development. Their dedication to innovation and hard work is an inspiration to future generations of engineers and scientists in India and around the world.</p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>One of the primary goals of Avishkar Hyperloop is to develop a transportation system that is safe, sustainable, and affordable. The company plans to achieve this by utilizing cutting-edge technology and materials that are both energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. This will not only benefit the environment but also reduce the cost of travel, making it accessible to more people.

Another aim of Avishkar Hyperloop is to reduce travel times significantly. By transporting passengers and goods at high speeds, the system will enable people to travel between cities in a matter of minutes rather than hours. This will not only save time but also increase productivity, as people will be able to work or rest during their journey.

Furthermore, Avishkar Hyperloop aims to improve connectivity between cities and regions, making it easier for people to access different parts of the country. This will help to promote economic growth and development by facilitating the movement of goods and people.n conclusion, Avishkar Hyperloop has a bold vision for the future of transportation, and its goals are admirable and exciting. By developing a safe, sustainable, and affordable transportation system, Avishkar Hyperloop has the potential to revolutionize the way we travel and connect people and regions in a way that has never been seen before.</p>

        <h2>Our Work</h2>
      <p> In September 2017, a team from IIT Madras began its journey towards realising the Hyperloop dream as Team Avishkar Hyperloop. In our first attempt, we came out as one among the top 47 teams. Motivation of the team grew exponentially by this news and also by hordes of feedbacks and suggestions received from various stakeholders. With greater enthusiasm, we participated in the next edition of the competition, the SpaceX Pod Competition 2019. In this attempt, we stood as the only Asian team among the Top 21 Finalists and showcased our pod to the world at the SpaceX HQ. Following this achievement, filled with zeal and determination, we eyed the European Hyperloop Week (EHW) 2021. We doubled down on sustainability and scalability of our system and kept burning our midnight oil (or should we say electricity). Our consistent hardwork led to many nominations and awards, most significant of which was bagging the 'Most Scalable Design' award, which reaffirmed our conviction in scalable research. With the same excitement and determination, we went on to participate in Europen Hyperloop Week (EHW) 2022. We emerged in the Global Top 5 in 3 categories - Electrical Subsystem, Traction Subsystem and Complete Pod Category. Currently, we have expanded our horizons and are focusing on taking a giant leap. We are aiming to build a 500m long vacuum tube facility at IIT Madras and establish a Centre for Hyperloop Excellence at IIT Madras in collaboration with the Indian Railways. We also intend to conduct a Global Hyperloop Competition at IIT Madras at the 500m vacuum tube facility.   <p>

          <p></p>
          <p>Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, unveiled the idea of Hyperloop to the World through a White Paper - Hyperloop Alpha. It is the fifth mode of transportation that moves freight and people quickly, safely and directly from the origin to destination. Passengers or cargos are loaded into the Hyperloop pod and accelerated gradually via electric propulsion through a low-pressure tube.</p>
